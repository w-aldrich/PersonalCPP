# TripPlanner
This is a fairly simple project to help me plan trips. Helps calculate MPG, total distance traveled based off of stops between gas fill ups, total cost of the trip for gas, how many gallons were used in gas, how often to stop for gas insuring that you have 1/2 tank of gas left, and the average distance between gas stops that you have done.

I have added a python script (that is a basic web scraper that searches google) to find the size of your gas tank if it is unknown.
(This is still to be implemented into the project itself)
